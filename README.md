# gifSearch

## Overview

This project is a simple demonstration of using the Fetch API to retrieve GIFs from the Giphy API based on user input and displaying them on a webpage. It's intended as a learning exercise for understanding how to make HTTP requests and manipulate the DOM in JavaScript.

## Features

- Allows users to input search terms for GIFs.
- Retrieves GIFs from the Giphy API based on the user's search terms.
- Displays the retrieved GIF on the webpage.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Enter a search term in the input box and submit the form.
4. The GIF corresponding to the search term will be displayed on the webpage.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the webpage.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for fetching GIFs from the Giphy API and updating the DOM.

## Dependencies

- This project utilizes the Giphy API to fetch GIFs. You will need an API key from Giphy to make requests. Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` in the `fetch` URL with your actual API key.
- Ensure an internet connection is available to fetch GIFs from the Giphy API.
